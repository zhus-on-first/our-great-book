Chapter 1

Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Now what? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. I don't want to be rescued. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!
Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!
I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.

Yeah, lots of people did. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. And then the battle's not so bad?

I'll get my kit!
No, just a regular mistake.
Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

With gusto. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. I'm a thing. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Bender?! You stole the atom. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

Shut up and get to the point! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Why yes! Thanks for noticing.

Bender, you risked your life to save me! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Your best is an idiot!

Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Kids have names? OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.

I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

Really?! It doesn't look so shiny to me. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.

Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!

Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.
