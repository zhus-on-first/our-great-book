# Chapter 2: Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. **_catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself.** _Stop talking, brain thinking._ Hush.

## I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

You've swallowed a planet! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

1. _Insistently_ Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
2. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
3. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

### Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

- Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
- Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
- I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. _catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. You've swallowed a planet! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

Saving the world with meals on wheels. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Saving the world with meals on wheels.

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
